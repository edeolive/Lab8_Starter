## Check Your Understanding Questions

1. 1\. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed.\
Option 1 is where our automated tests should fit in the project development pipeline because it keeps the code tested as code is written and makes it so that people don't forget to test code, since it is automated.
2. No.
3. No, because a unit test is to test small individual parts of code, like a function or a "module" of code. The message feature itself would be better to test with end to end testing.
4. Yes, because in this case the feature is a small unit of the larger code and has well defined inputs and outputs.
